        <p>Green Haven Hostel was born out of a passion for travel, community, and sustainability. Our founders,
           [Soumya] and [Sunita], met while backpacking through Europe and realized the importance of affordable, welcoming, 
           and environmentally-friendly accommodations. Since opening our doors in [2006], we've become a beloved hub for
            like-minded individuals seeking adventure, connection, and relaxation.
